# Introduction

> Qiscus Javascript SDK For Web

**qis**cus SDK helps you build Web Chat Application easy and fast. It uses **qis**cus server backend for the API.
There's two version of the SDK. The SDK Core Only version which you can use to build a custom chat app without opinionated view layer.
The other version is the one with `View` layer already integrated in it (in this case we're using VueJs, other view layer already on TODO list).
You can download all this files by navigating to the [release](https://github.com/qiscus/qiscus-sdk-web/releases) section.

# Installation and Usage

## SDK with Integrated Widget View
This version let you add a chat widget directly into your existing HTML web pages. 
You just need to include the javascript and css files from the build directory. 
And you also need to append `<div id="qiscus-widget"></div>` tag before closing body tag. Here's sample HTML:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Qiscus Chat</title>
  <link rel=stylesheet href=https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.3/css/font-awesome.min.css>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/qiscus-sdk/web/v1.5.0/css/qiscus-sdk.1.5.0.css"> 
</head>
<body>
  <div id="qiscus-widget"></div>
  <script src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/qiscus-sdk/web/v1.5.0/js/qiscus-sdk.1.5.0.js"></script>
  <script>
     qiscus.setUser('your@email.com', 'key', 'username');
     qiscus.init({AppId: 'dragongo'});
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The javascript file introduce a new global variable called `qiscus`. We'll use that to initiate our chat widget.

``` javascript
// Set Current User for the Chat Widget
qiscus.setUser('email@email.com', 'key', 'username');
// Init the widget
qiscus.init({AppId: 'dragongo'});
```

You can get `AppId` by requesting one from [sdk.qiscus.com](http://sdk.qiscus.com)



### -- ADVANCED SECTION BELOW --



## SDK Core Only Version
Download the javascript file from the [release](https://github.com/qiscus/qiscus-sdk-web/releases) page, then include in your main `js` file.

```javascript
// in case you have support for ES6 Syntax else just use good 'ol require
import qiscus from 'path/to/qiscus-sdk-core.version_number'

qiscus.setUser('email@email.com','key','username');
qiscus.init({AppId: 'dragongo'});
```

## CSS Classes

The widget is built using vuejs and divided into several components. We also use fontawesome for the icon, so you can target fontawesome css class directly. You can change the appearance of the widget by using these css selectors below.

Widget components have namespaces of `qcw...`
