# Introduction

> Qiscus Javascript SDK For Web

**qis**cus SDK helps you build Web Chat Application easy and fast. It uses **qis**cus server backend for the API.
There's two version of the SDK. The SDK Core Only version which you can use to build a custom chat app without opinionated view layer.
The other version is the one with `View` layer already integrated in it (in this case we're using VueJs, other view layer already on TODO list).
You can download all this files by navigating to the [release](https://github.com/qiscus/qiscus-sdk-web/releases) section.

# Installation and Usage

## SDK with Integrated Widget View
This version let you add a chat widget directly into your existing HTML web pages. 
You just need to include the javascript and css files from the build directory. 
And you also need to append `<div id="qiscus-widget"></div>` tag before closing body tag. Here's sample HTML:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Document</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/qiscus-sdk/web/v1.5.0/css/qiscus-sdk.1.5.0.css"> 
</head>
<body>
  <div id="qiscus-widget"></div>
  <script src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/qiscus-sdk/web/v1.5.0/js/qiscus-sdk.1.5.0.js"></script>
  <script>
     qiscus.setUser('your@email.com', 'key', 'username');
     qiscus.init({AppId: 'dragongo'});
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

The javascript file introduce a new global variable called `qiscus`. We'll use that to initiate our chat widget.

``` javascript
// Set Current User for the Chat Widget
qiscus.setUser('email@email.com', 'key', 'username');
// Init the widget
qiscus.init({AppId: 'dragongo'});
```

You can get `AppId` by requesting one from [sdk.qiscus.com](http://sdk.qiscus.com)
